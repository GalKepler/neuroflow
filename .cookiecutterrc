# This file exists so you can easily regenerate your project.
#
# `cookiepatcher` is a convenient shim around `cookiecutter`
# for regenerating projects (it will generate a .cookiecutterrc
# automatically for any template). To use it:
#
#    pip install cookiepatcher
#    cookiepatcher gh:ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary neuroflow
#
# See:
#    https://pypi.org/project/cookiepatcher
#
# Alternatively, you can run:
#
#    cookiecutter --overwrite-if-exists --config-file=neuroflow/.cookiecutterrc gh:ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary
